I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.orie.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">School of
Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) of Cornell University</a>, working with <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/" target="_blank">Prof. Peter Frazier</a>.

<br />
My research focuses on the development and analysis of Bayesian optimization algorithms, and their
application for training machine learning algorithms, optimization via simulation, and design of experiments.

<br />
Previously, from 2016 to 2017, I did a one year internship at <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a>
as a data scientist, where I worked on pricing and transportation problems.

<br />
Before joining Cornell, I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics by the <a href="http://www.cimat.mx/" target="_blank">Center for Mathematical Research (CIMAT)</a>
under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cimat.mx/~pabreu/" target="_blank">Prof. Victor Perez-Abreu</a>.
